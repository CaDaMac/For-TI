# For-TI
# The "Lab7" runs on an Arduino board and controls a car-like robot. 
# The code tells the bot to look for a black line on the ground and to follow it through all turns.
# If no line is found, it will turn in a large circle until a line is found. 
# "Turn" is a support function for "Lab7". 
# All of this code require Arduino support code and specific support code for the robot. 
# This code is not included since it is not made/ owned by me. 

#"Galaga" was originally meant to be a clone of the original Galaga game as a test of my skills. But evolved into an original game.
#The name was never changed for "Galaga". 
#Galaga.jar should be executable from any desktop with java installed.
