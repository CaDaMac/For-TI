# For-TI
# The "Lab7" runs on an Arduino board and controls a car-like robot. 
# The code tells the bot to look for a black line on the ground and to follow it through all turns.
# If no line is found, it will turn in a large circle untill a line is found. 
# "Turn" is a support function for "Lab7". 
# All of this code require Arduino support code and specific support code for the robot. 
# This code is not included since it is not made/ owned by me.
